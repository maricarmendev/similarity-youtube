# Notes about the projects


## Installed dependencies:
### `@mui/material`, `@emotion/react` and `@emotion/styled`: 
Is an open source react components library that implements Google's Material Design.
Material ui has two dependencies: `@emotion/react` and `@emotion/style`.
Emotion is a library designed for writing css styles with JavaScript. It provides powerful and predictable style composition in addition to a great developer experience with features such as source maps, labels, and testing utilities. 
The `@emotion/react` package requires React and is recommended for users of that framework if possible.
The `@emotion/styled` package is for those who prefer to use the styled.div style API for creating components.

### `@mui/x-data-grid`
MUI X is a collection of advanced UI components, including a data grid and date and time pickers.
These components are significantly more complex than the ones found in the MUI Core libraries. They feature advanced functionality for data-rich applications and a wide range of other use cases.

### `class-variance-authority`
CSS-in-TS libraries such as Stitches(opens in a new tab) and Vanilla Extract(opens in a new tab) are fantastic options for building type-safe UI components; taking away all the worries of class names and StyleSheet composition.
â€¦but CSS-in-TS (or CSS-in-JS) isn't for everyone.
You may need full control over your StyleSheet output. Your job might require you to use a framework such as Tailwind CSS. You might just prefer writing your own CSS.
Creating variants with the "traditional" CSS approach can become an arduous task; manually matching classes to props and manually adding types.
cva aims to take those pain points away, allowing you to focus on the more fun aspects of UI development.

### `clsx`
A tiny (228B) utility for constructing className strings conditionally.
Also serves as a faster & smaller drop-in replacement for the classnames module.

[clsx npm site](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx)

### `date-fns`
date-fns provides the most comprehensive, yet simple and consistent toolset for manipulating JavaScript dates in a browser & Node.js.

### `openai`
The OpenAI Node.js library provides convenient access to the OpenAI API from Node.js applications. Most of the code in this library is generated from our OpenAPI specification.
Important note: this library is meant for server-side usage only, as using it in client-side browser code will expose your secret API key. See here for more details.

[openai npm site] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/openai)

### `prism-react-renderer`
Maybe you need to render some extra UI with your Prismjs-highlighted code, or maybe you'd like to manipulate what Prism renders completely, or maybe you're just using Prism with React and are searching for an easier, global-pollution-free way?
Then you're right where you want to be!

### `react-hot-toast`
The Best Toast in Town. Smoking hot React notifications.

### `sharp`
The typical use case for this high speed Node.js module is to convert large images in common formats to smaller, web-friendly JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF and AVIF images of varying dimensions.
Resizing an image is typically 4x-5x faster than using the quickest ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick settings due to its use of libvips .
Colour spaces, embedded ICC profiles and alpha transparency channels are all handled correctly. Lanczos resampling ensures quality is not sacrificed for speed.

### `simplebar-react`
SimpleBar does only one thing: replace the browser's default scrollbar with a custom CSS-styled one without losing performances. Unlike some popular plugins, SimpleBar doesn't mimic scroll with Javascript, causing janks and strange scrolling behaviours... You keep the awesomeness of native scrolling...with a custom scrollbar! SimpleBar does NOT implement a custom scroll behaviour. It keeps the native overflow: auto scroll and only replace the scrollbar visual appearance.

### `tailwind-merge`
Utility function to efficiently merge Tailwind CSS classes in JS without style conflicts.
